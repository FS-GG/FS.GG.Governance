# The RUNTIME SKILL-ROOT SET this repo declares — asserted on every `skill-view-check` run, which is a
# REQUIRED status check on `main`.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (FS-GG/.github#1748, ADR-0067 §9 phase 4). This repo used to commit its skills TWICE:
# `.claude/skills` and `.agents/skills` each held the same 15 skills in 34 byte-identical tracked files
# (`diff -r` between them was SILENT at 37c12d1, measured before anything was retired). Phase 4 retired
# the second copy: `.agents/skills` is now a VIEW root (ADR-0065 §A root's three dispositions) whose
# content `scripts/skill-view generate` resolves from `.claude/skills` at checkout. The union of
# `<FsggKitSkillRoots>` and `<FsggKitViewSkillRoots>` is the runtime root set, and it did not change.
#
# WHAT THE RETIREMENT GAVE UP, WHICH IS THE ONLY REASON THIS FILE IS HERE. Before it, a change that
# dropped `.agents/skills` from this repo's runtime contract would have been caught by
# `coordination-coherence`: the root was materialized into, so removing it produced missing files
# against the pin. Now it is not materialized into, and every gate that could notice goes QUIET instead
# of red. MEASURED ON THIS REPO'S OWN TREE, 2026-07-28, with the root emptied out of
# `<FsggKitViewSkillRoots>` and the directory deleted:
#
#   * `dotnet build .config/kit/FS.GG.Kit.receiver.proj -t:FsggKitMaterialize`
#       -> "FS.GG.Kit: no view skill roots declared (FsggKitViewSkillRoots is empty) — nothing to
#          assert."  Build succeeded, 0 errors.
#   * `coordination-sync --check --against-pin --repo FS-GG/FS.GG.Governance --include-build-config .`
#       -> "OK — all 30 materialized file(s) match the FS.GG.Kit 0.15.0 this tree pins."
#          That is the REQUIRED context `kit / coordination-kit`, green on exactly the tree this alarm
#          exists to fail.
#
# Both green, and `.agents/skills` simply gone from the runtime contract. The only observable
# consequence would be that Codex resolves zero skills here and exits 0 saying nothing (ADR-0067 §8's
# measured silent class). That is exactly the trade ADR-0067 §8 forbids — "a rewrite that removes the
# loud failure and adds the quiet one is worse than no rewrite" — so the retirement ships the
# replacement alarm in the same change. This is it.
#
# WHERE IT RIDES, AND WHY THAT HOST. FS.GG.Templates put the same assertion in `tests/composition/lib/`
# because `composition` is its required check; FS.GG.Audio made it a script on its required
# `Build + test` job because it has no such harness. This repo has neither a `composition` harness nor
# a required job that is both cheap and skill-shaped — except `skill-view-check`, which is REQUIRED on
# `main`, is authored here, needs no `dotnet` or restore, and already has the retired root's generate
# step in front of it. So the alarm rides `skill-view-check`. That is FS.GG.Audio's shape (a
# repo-owned script on an already-required context), not a fourth one; FS.GG.Net's shape — a NEW gate
# job that is not required — is the one to avoid, and FS-GG/.github#1727 is open about it.
# FS-GG/.github#1710 owns collapsing the three copies; this is the third payment of that cost and it
# should be recorded as such rather than quietly repeated a fourth time.
#
# IT GRADES THE DECLARATION, NOT MSBUILD'S EVALUATION, and that is deliberate rather than lazy. The
# faithful alternative is `dotnet msbuild -getProperty:` on the receiver project, which needs a RESTORE
# of the pinned FS.GG.Kit — a network round-trip and a .NET SDK added to a REQUIRED check that
# currently needs neither, to grade a two-line fact this repo authors in its own tree. It would also
# introduce a second source of truth for the package's defaults: a property this repo does NOT declare
# evaluates to the package default, so a text reader would have to restate `.claude/skills;.agents/skills`
# to interpret an absence, and a restated default is the invented-location bug one file over.
# Requiring BOTH properties to be declared EXPLICITLY removes the question: an absence is a RED, not a
# guess.
#
# Fails CLOSED throughout: an unreadable project, a missing property, a multi-line declaration this
# reader cannot parse, a union that is not ADR-0011's two, and a declared root that is not actually
# resolvable on disk are each a failure. "I could not look" is never "looked, and fine"
# (FS-GG/.github#266).
