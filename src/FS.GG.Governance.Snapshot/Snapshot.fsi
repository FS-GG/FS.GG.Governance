// Curated public signature contract for the PURE core of repository-snapshot sensing (F016).
//
// This .fsi is the SOLE declaration of the module's public surface (Constitution
// Principle II). The matching Snapshot.fs carries NO `private`/`internal`/`public` modifiers on
// top-level bindings — visibility is presence/absence here.
//
// Design-first artifact: drafted and exercised in FSI (scripts/prelude.fsx) before any
// Snapshot.fs body exists (Principle I). This is the PURE side of the I/O boundary
// (Constitution Principle IV, the lighter port/effect algebra — research D3, as F014's Loader):
// `planResolution` decides which refs to resolve from the options (pure), and `assemble` parses
// the raw sensed text, normalizes paths, categorizes, orders, and diagnoses them into a
// `RepoSnapshot`. Both are PURE and TOTAL — no I/O, no git, no clock, never throw, byte-for-byte
// identical for identical input (FR-009/FR-011, SC-002/SC-003). The actual git/CI sensing that
// fills `RawSensing` is the edge `Interpreter`'s job (Interpreter.fsi). Path normalization is
// single-sourced from the public `Config` normalizer (research D7), so the emitted `GovernedPath`s
// are byte-identical to what `Routing.route` consumes (SC-001).
