// The PURE MVU core of the `fsgg route` host command (F022). Visibility lives in Loop.fsi
// (Principle II) — this file carries NO top-level access modifiers; helper types/functions absent

// Effect data the edge Interpreter executes (Principle IV). It re-derives/re-sorts/re-classifies
// nothing the eight cores fixed, and computes NO ship verdict (FR-008).
