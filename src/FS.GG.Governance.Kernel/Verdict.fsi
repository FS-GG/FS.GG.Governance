// Curated public signature contract for the three-valued verdict algebra (F02).
//
// This .fsi is the SOLE declaration of the module's public surface (Constitution
// Principle II). The matching Verdict.fs carries NO `private`/`internal`/`public`
// modifiers on top-level bindings — visibility is presence/absence here.
//
// Design-first artifact: this contract is drafted and exercised in FSI
// (scripts/prelude.fsx) before any Verdict.fs body exists (Principle I). The shapes
// mirror docs/governance-design/kernel.md ("Verdicts") and the Hazard-2 reason
// mitigation in docs/governance-design/theory-and-composition.md (the authoritative
// model). The algebra lives IN the kernel assembly (roadmap §3) so the F03 `Check`
// interpreters reuse it with zero new dependencies.
